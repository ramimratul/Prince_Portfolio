        <h2 class="blog-title">Bridging AI and Software Development: A Journey in Problem-Solving</h2>
        <p class="blog-content">
            Technology is not just about writing code—it’s about solving real-world problems efficiently. 
            As I explore the intersection of <b>AI and software development</b>, I realize that both fields are deeply connected. 
            While <b>AI focuses on training models and extracting insights</b>, software development ensures those models are 
            <b>efficiently integrated into real-world applications</b>.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-content">
            <b>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</b> is revolutionizing the way we interact with technology. It enables machines to learn from data, 
            recognize patterns, and make decisions without explicit programming. From image recognition to recommendation systems, AI 
            is shaping industries like healthcare, finance, and automation.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-content">
            <b>Software development</b>, on the other hand, provides the necessary infrastructure and tools to bring AI into practical use. 
            Without efficient software, AI models would remain theoretical concepts. Software engineers build the frameworks, user interfaces, 
            and backend systems that allow AI to function seamlessly in everyday applications.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-content">
            <b>Data Science</b> plays a crucial role in AI and software development. It involves gathering, cleaning, and analyzing large datasets 
            to extract meaningful insights. Data scientists use statistics, machine learning, and programming skills to uncover trends 
            and drive decision-making processes that enhance AI performance.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-content">
            My journey in <b>CSE, AI, and problem-solving</b> has taught me that building impactful solutions requires a mix of 
            <b>data science, engineering principles, and practical implementation skills</b>. From <b>developing AI-powered tools</b> 
            to <b>creating efficient web solutions</b>, I aim to <b>leverage technology to improve systems globally</b>.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-content">
            This blog will document my experiences, projects, and insights as I grow in this field—turning ideas into real, working solutions. Stay tuned!
