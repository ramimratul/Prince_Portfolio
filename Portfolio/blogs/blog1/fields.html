                <p>
                    Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—such as storage, processing power, and software—over the internet. This enables users to access and utilize resources on-demand without the need to own or manage 
                    physical infrastructure. With cloud computing, businesses and individuals can take advantage of flexible, scalable, and cost-effective solutions, allowing them to focus on innovation and operational efficiency. 
                    Cloud services are provided through different models, including Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), which offers virtualized computing resources; Platform as a Service (PaaS), which provides a platform for building 
                    and deploying applications; and Software as a Service (SaaS), which delivers software applications over the internet. These models allow businesses to choose the services that best meet their needs, whether it’s hosting 
                    infrastructure, developing applications, or using software without worrying about hardware maintenance. By leveraging cloud computing, organizations can streamline their operations, reduce costs associated with maintaining 
                    physical infrastructure, and enhance their agility. Cloud computing enables quick scaling of resources to meet changing demands, making it easier for businesses to adapt to market conditions, improve collaboration, and focus 
                    on core activities without the burden of IT management. As a result, cloud computing has become an essential tool for businesses seeking to remain competitive in today’s fast-paced digital environment.
                </p>
                <h2>Why Is Cloud Computing Popular?</h2>
                <p>
                    Cloud computing has gained immense popularity because it eliminates the need for users to invest in expensive hardware and infrastructure. Instead, users can access software, storage, and processing power on-demand over the internet. 
                    This not only reduces upfront costs but also offers scalability, flexibility, and efficiency. For businesses, cloud computing provides a cost-effective way to access high-performance computing resources without the burden of maintaining 
                    physical hardware. Startups and small businesses, in particular, benefit from cloud computing by gaining access to the same enterprise-level technology that larger companies use, without the high costs. Cloud services enable businesses 
                    to scale quickly and easily, adding or reducing resources based on demand, which is especially valuable in fast-paced industries. Additionally, the cloud offers seamless collaboration, with teams able to access files and applications from 
                    anywhere, improving productivity and innovation. The pay-as-you-go model is another factor contributing to cloud computing’s popularity, as it allows users to pay only for the resources they actually use, further reducing costs and improving 
                    financial flexibility. This has made cloud computing the backbone of modern businesses and startups, allowing them to innovate and grow without the limitations of traditional IT infrastructure.
